Description: 
        IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Python
        interactively.  Its main components are:
        
        * A powerful interactive Python shell
        * A `Jupyter <http://jupyter.org/>`_ kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter
          notebooks and other interactive frontends.
        
        The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features:
        
        * Comprehensive object introspection.
        
        * Input history, persistent across sessions.
        
        * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
          references.
        
        * Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python
          variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.
        
        * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
          performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
        
        * A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups
          (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
        
        * Session logging and reloading.
        
        * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
        
        * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
        
        * Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.
        
        * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.
        
        The latest development version is always available from IPython's `GitHub
        site <http://github.com/ipython>`_.
